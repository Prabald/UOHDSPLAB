 Maximum number of files: 1
Type of work:  Individual work
### Implement the following C functions related to Binary Search Tree (BST)

- Insert(BST, e) : insert element e into BST

- Delete(BST, e): delete element e from the BST

- LookUp(BST, e): search if element e is present in the BST. Returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.

- GetHight(BST): returns the height of the BST

- PrintSorted(BST): Displays the elements of the BST in non-decreasing order. (In-order traversal)

 

Now write a menu driven test function main() to test the functions of BST.

1 e : insert element e into the BST

2 e: delete element e from the BST

3 e: check is element is there in the bst

4: display the hight of the tree

5: print element of the BST in ascending order

-1: exit

### Sample Input/Output:

input=1 50 1 30 1 20 1 40 1 70 1 80 1 60 5 4 3 40 3 90 2 20 2 30 2 50 2 80 4 3 20 3 60 5 -1

output=20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2 1 0 1 0 1 40 60 70
