Type of work:  Individual work
### Implement the following C functions related to AVL Search Tree (AVLT)

- Insert(AVLT, e) : insert element e into AVL Tree

- Delete(AVLT, e): delete element e from the AVL Tree

- LookUp(AVLT, e): search if element e is present in the AVL Tree . Returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.

- GetHight(AVLT): returns the height of the AVL Tree

- PrintSorted(AVLT): Displays the elements of the AVL Tree in non-decreasing order. (In-order traversal)

- You need to implement rotation function and use them as and when required to make the tree balanced

Now write a menu driven test function main() to test the functions of AVL Tree.

1 e : insert element e into the AVL Tree

2 e: delete element e from the AVL Tree

3 e: check is element is there in the bst

4: display the hight of the tree

5: print element of the AVL Tree in ascending order

-1: exit
